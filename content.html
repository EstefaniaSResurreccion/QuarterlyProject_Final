                <h1> Agriculture </h1>
                <p>Our country's agriculture consists of fishery, farming, livestock, and forestry. Just a few years after the 
                    global pandemic, the agricultural status of the Philippines rose by 19% in the year 2023. One of the problems 
                    that this sector is currently facing is our reliance on imports, especially with rice. However, in recent cases,
                     exports from our country have also flourished. </p>

                <h1> Imports and Exports </h1>
                <p> How did importing rice become a problem? One of the reasons is because we relied on it too much, impacting not 
                    only local farmers and their harvest but also the price of these products. Although even if we do lessen our imports,
                    we would also have a significant shortage. According to (BusinessMirror Editorial, 2024), "The latest data from the
                    Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) attest to the fact that the country remains reliant on foreign farmers for its
                     food supply." This justifies how the Philippines heavily relies on imports as much as or even more than its exports.</p>
                  
                <p>As we can see in the data below in the Export department of our agriculture, it has been observed that in 
                    recent cases it rose up to 10.7 percent in value. These include products such 
                    as vegetables, fruits, nuts, and many more products. With this news, our country
                    might reach its goal of 2028 as an export powerhouse (PSA, 2024).</p>
