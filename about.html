                <h1> Vision </h1>
                <p> Our main goal is for the general public to be informed about these kinds of social issues and on how it is important. 
                    May it be for our daily lives or our future. By being informed we can spread awareness about it and find ways
                    how we can help especially the working class in this category. Such as helping local workers such as farmers and fishermen 
                    with thier bussiness, making them boom in the industry and for them to be able to keep up with the demands of our country. </p>

                <h1> Mission </h1>
                <p> As years pass by the economy of our agriculture and fishery sector expand. Although it has yet to be on track in 
                    recent years, this is due to many grounds such as the pandemic, weak export movements, unsustainable farming practices,
                    and many more. Thus this website aims to help our growing population be informed and aware. This project also aims to help achive
                    one of the targets, Decent work and economic growth, in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that is planned to be achieved by the year 2030.
